# deligo
experiments with go/golang web programming

i've been thinking for some more or less practical tasks to learn Go and came up with this: the ultimate goal is a web server adding links to delicious. apart from web / backedn programming it is also an exercise in a tiny bit of frontend tasks: intergrating bootstrap and some jquery into the final "product"

for simple communication with delicious api i used code from https://github.com/josegm/yummy/, since for some reason my hacks didn't work.
other than that the code used http package with Gorilla's mux. 
i had a lot of fun with the frontend, header.html, where i played somewhat with bootstrap and jquery's ajax
